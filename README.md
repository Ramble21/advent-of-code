My solutions to the popular annual Advent of Code programming problems!

Every solution should work universally with all inputs*, so feel free to use this repo to help you with your own AoC solutions (keeping in mind that I might not be the best role model for good and efficient code)


| Year | Total Stars |   Total Runtime    |  Language  |
|:----:|:-----------:|:------------------:|:----------:|
| 2025 |     25      | Not completed yet  |   Python   |
| 2024 |     50      |      ~9500 ms      |    Java    |
| 2023 |     50      |    ~13000 ms**     |    Java    |

*2024 day 17 is specifically hardcoded to my input

**The algorithm used to solve 2023 day 25 is randomized, meaning that the code for it could run instantaneously or take several minutes to complete. For that, I excluded it from the listed total.
