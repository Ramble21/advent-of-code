Language: Java

Every solution should work universally with all inputs, except 2024 day 17 which is specifically hardcoded to my input. Feel free to use this repo to help you with your own AoC solutions, however I might not be the best role model for good and efficient code lol

The algorithm used to solve 2023 day 25 is randomized, meaning that the code for it could run instantaneously or take several minutes to complete. Apart from this, all solutions should work at relatively similar times, with marginal differences due to hardware.
